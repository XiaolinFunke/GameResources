LH = Left hand (keyboard)
RH = Right hand (mouse) - tend to be slower

Default method uses a lot of RH actions. If we could make some of those LH actions, they could be done in tandem and save speed and accuracy

Wisp juggling:

Normal method:
RH: Select wisp                             
RH: Move wisp to mine                     
RH: Select Mine                             
RH: Unload Wisp                            
RH: Select Wisp                             
RH: Move wisp to mine                     

6 RH actions


Shift-Queue Method (1 less action needed, but timing is harder)
RH: Select wisp
RH: Move wisp near mine
LH + RH: Shift move wisp to mine
RH: Select Mine
RH: Unload Wisp

5 RH actions

Hotkey Mine Method (1 action is moved to left hand)
RH: Select Wisp
RH: Move wisp near mine
LH: Select Mine with hotkey
RH: Unload Wisp
RH: Select Wisp
RH: Move wisp to mine

5 RH actions


Hotkey Mine Method + Shift-Queue Method (1 action is moved to left hand AND 1 less action needed, but timing is harder)
RH: Select Wisp
RH: Move wisp near mine
LH + RH: Shift move wisp to mine
LH: Select Mine with hotkey
RH: Unload Wisp

4 RH actions



Hotkey Mine AND Wisp Method (2 actions are moved to left hand, but an has an additional LH action)
RH: Select Wisp
LH: Hotkey wisp
RH: Move wisp to mine
LH: Select mine with hotkey
RH: Unload wisp
LH: Select wisp with hotkey
RH: Move wisp to mine

4 RH actions


Conclusions:
Hotkeying the mine appears to be good on paper because it saves a RH action, BUT I'm not sure it's that good
because that action isn't that hard anyway. You've always just right-clicked the mine, so left-clicking it immediately after is not a big deal


Can also do "unload all" on the mine to save one of the most demanding RH actions, but you do lose out on gold, so only should do that if necessary (or if have 2 wisps you need to save at once)

So, I'm thinking the best two options are:
Shift-Queue method
Hotkeying Wisp ONLY method

Since they both save the action of having to reselect the wisp

Down-side of shift-queue method is you might get the timing wrong
Down-side of hotkey method is you need a free hotkey and it's maybe slightlty harder to execute

Let's compare further:

Shift-Queue method:
RH: Select wisp                    Same in both
RH: Move wisp near mine            Slighy harder here because you need to go near mine but not on it
LH + RH: Shift move wisp to mine   Easier because you're already right near the mine with mouse
RH: Select Mine                    Same in both
RH: Unload Wisp                    Same in both

RH: Select new wisp                Harder because your mouse isn't near the mine
RH: Move new wisp                  Same in both


Tracking mouse movement and selections:

SELECT Wisp -----> Near mine ----> Mine + SELECT mine ---> SELECT new wisp   ----> move wisp
												|	
												|
												|
											Unload wisp

Hotkey Wisp method:
RH: Select wisp               Same in both
RH: Move wisp to mine         Slightly easier here because you can click the mine
LH: Hotkey wisp               Not too hard, can do while moving wisp
RH: Select mine               Same in both
RH: Unload Wisp               Same in both
LH: Select wisp with hotkey   Not hard
RH: Move wisp to mine         Takes some mouse movement because you're coming up from having clicked a wisp out of the mine

RH: Select new wisp           Easier because you're already at the mine
RH: Move new wisp             Same in both


SELECT Wisp ----->  Mine + SELECT mine ---> Mine   ----> SELECT new wisp ----> move wisp

						Unload wisp
						
						
They seem a similar level of efficiency, but						
I prefer the hotkey wisp method because the shift-queue method can go wrong if the wisp is too close to the mine (wisp arrives too soon) and allows for less fleixbility if the wisp ends up needing to detonate, or make a building, or go into the mine sooner than expected, or doesn't need to end up going in the mine at all
