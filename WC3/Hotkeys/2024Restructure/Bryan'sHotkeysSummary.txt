W3Champions hotkey setting works well except:
Can't move build or rally icons because it doesn't know about the special entries needed
It always adds extra entries for tier3 main upgrades which means that key doesn't get rebound properly unless you remove those
It doesn't allow you to move the icon of some passives like spell immunity, elune's grace, etc. which have special entries in the customkeys
