W3Champions hotkey setting works well except:
Can't move build or rally icons because it doesn't know about the special entries needed
No way to rebind ice troll merc camps
It always adds extra entries for tier3 main upgrades which means that key doesn't get rebound properly unless you remove those
It also has an extra entry for purge that doesn't get changed
It doesn't allow you to move the icon of some passives like spell immunity, elune's grace, etc. which have special entries in the customkeys
Some of these issues might be due to me starting with a non-W3champions-generated customkeys file, but in general, the site I found works better

Only issue with the site (https://jcfieldsdev.github.io/warcraft3-hotkey-editor/):
Rally point still doesn't move unless you have that extra entry (which it will not keep in your file if you save)
