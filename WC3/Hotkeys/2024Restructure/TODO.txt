1. When reviving heroes at altar or "awaken"ing them at tavern, they always go to button position 0,0. As far as I can see, there doesn't appear to be a way to change this
2. Shredder, ice troll priest are in the wrong position for buying, but their button position does not appear to be respected. Not sure if there's a way to fix it
3. When you've selected to build a building with a worker, you can "Cancel", but as far as I know there is no way to change the key of that particular "Cancel". All other cancels seem to work, so not a huge deal, since you can just right click instead
4. Could update tooltips for hotkeys that are macro mode modifier + a key, but Reforged changed how the tooltips work, so I don't appear to be able to change them
5. Gargoyle 'prioritize' doesn't appear in the correct spot on the command card for some reason
