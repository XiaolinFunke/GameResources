3 Melee and 3 casters in each wave. Melee give more XP

Level 2: 1st Wave + 1 melee minion
			Can also skip 1 caster from first wave to get faster
			
Level 3: 2 waves + 2 melee minions

Level 4: 3 waves + 3 melee + 1 caster

Level 6: Around 5:15 game time

Every level up is equivalent to around 600 gold. Beating opponent to a level up can be huge. Try to make sure your cooldowns are ready when that happens


Crashing fourth wave into enemy tower and then TPing to get items can be good because they will not get level 5 before you are back (Levels 2-4 happen on waves 2-4, but level 5 doesn't happen until wave 6)
Crashing needs to be done quickly, before enemy creeps are there so all of your creeps aggro on enemy turret
