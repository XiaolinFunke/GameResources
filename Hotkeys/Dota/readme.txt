Keys and Screenshots updated as of 01/30/2023:

Bryan's hotkey scheme:

Bryan's Logitech GHub automatically maps Front and Back mouse button to Left and Right arrow keys respectively, and DPI mouse button to 0. This makes some of the hotkeys as they appear in the game confusing, but they are annotated in the screenshots

BACK SIDE MOUSE BUTTON:
(Mapped to Ctrl via AHK script)
Hold back mouse button to learn new abilities on level-up


FRONT SIDE MOUSE BUTTON:
(Mapped to alt via in-game hotkeys)
Can use for pinging (map and hero is missing), changing map hero icons, seeing creep boxes/tower radius (or can use Z for those, may be more comfortable)
Hold front mouse button to self-cast items and abilities (faster than double-tapping)





UNIT HOTKEYS:
Hotkey1 (main hero): Space
Hotkey2: C
Hotkey3: W
Use G for select all units

Set via Shift + that hotkey


LOCATION HOTKEYS:
Hotkey1 (Top lane): Alt + W
Hotkey2 (Bottom lane): Alt + G
Hotkey3 (Mid lane): Alt + C
Hotkey4 (Rosh/Misc): Alt + 3

Set using Ctrl or Back mouse button + Alt + key

INVENTORY KEYS:
Inventory keys are mapped (via AHK) as the same keys as hero abilities, but while holding alt. They are set up like this:

Inventory:
Alt + A   |   Alt + S   |   Alt + E
Alt + F   |   Alt + D   |   Alt + R

Neutral Item active is Alt + T


EASY SHIFT-ATK-MOVE:
For some heroes, like Enigma, it may be necessary to shift-queue atk-move commands.
For this, I've used AHK to map '4' to 'Shift'. 4 + Capslock is much easier to hit than Shift + Capslock



CTRL-CLICKING AND SUBGROUP-ORDER MODIFIER KEY
Using AHK, I've mapped Alt to function as Ctrl for Ctrl-clicking and use of subgroup-order modifier key, since alt is easier to hit for me




WINDOWS KEY:
I've mapped Windows key to alt, so it isn't accidentally hit



CAPS LOCK:
I've mapped Capslock to M (used as atk). This ensures it is a usable key without toggling your capslock all the time'



Z AS ALT:
I've also mapped Z to alt in the AHK, so there are two options for alt, depending on what is more comfortable in a given situation (front side mouse button, or Z)
