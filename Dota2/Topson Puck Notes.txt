Topson Puck notes:

At -3s game time, can be near safe rune and use orb, then grab it and jaunt
Harrassing enemy melee hero (ember) a lot
Getting extra hits in due to aggro cooldown
Using stop as well as left/right for blocking?
Waning rift at level 2 can help secure last hits as well (if don't need phase shift until lvl 4)
Orb towards 2nd rune when 1/3 of the way between midline and 1st rune can help you get both runes
Clearing wave with orb towards a rune can also help grab them without missing much
Don't forget gold runes at 3:00 intervals

Golem creeps can be finished with an orb that then also hits their death-spawned guys

blink in and then do all spells and orb pop out. Hit more reliably with orb and can get out more reliably

mage slayer is insane right now (Patch 7.35b), and can be applied to everyone with puck shard (unlike witch's blade)

Mage Slayer vs. Witch's Blade:
-150 cost
+5 attack speed
+0.5 mana regen
-6 armor
-2 int
-300 Atk Projectile speed
+25% magic resist
20 DPS for 6 seconds vs. 0.75 * int for 4 seconds (Witch's blade is generally much more DPS, but can only be applied once every 9s)
0 cooldown vs. 9s cooldown
40% less spell dmg on people hit vs. 25% slow on people hit


When team is in deep and you want to help but have a bad feeling about it, blink in and orb backward, use all spells and then pop out
Hitting multiple camps with orb can be good if they are close, but otherwise can just orb in direction you want to go after


Dendi:
Can skip boots and get a fast witch's blade sometimes
Go for both runes with the orb trick!
When trying to dmg from afar, don't just throw orb --- blink in, silence, orb, then atk, then phase shift and jaunt


Early last-hitting. Throw attack first and THEN orb
