Stacking times:
X:55 always works

Double stacking:
X:53 and X:55 always works if you do bigger camp then smaller camp
Works for both sides small/big camps and ancients
Works for Dire triangle (with either set)
Doesn't work for radiant triangle normally


Pulling:
Simplest ones:
Small camp for Safe lane - X:17 and X:47
Large camp for Offlane - X:16 and X:46



For practice:
-startgame
-item dagon_5
-spawnneutrals
-teleport
-item blink
-item philosophers_stone
